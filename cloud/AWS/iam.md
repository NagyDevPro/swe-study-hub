# Identy Access Management

is a service that enables your `root` user to give permissions to another account to use services wisely and to avoid any mis-usage of the root account

* Iam user can login through: -
1. login to the console and choose account info
2. login through account

**Granular Access**: You can create a group of users with permissions to this group *Users inside this group by default inherit the permissions of the group*

**Shared Access | Cross account access**: giving permission to a non-root account from another non-root account

* IAM service supports *Identy Feditration*
* IAM Service is *Eventually consistent* `takes some time to apply the permission`

* IAM Service is *Totally free*



## TODO: Study more about the iam service.
