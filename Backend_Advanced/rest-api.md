# Rest API

## Meaning
- is an acronym for **REpresentational State Transfer**
- Architectural style for `distributed` `hypermedia` systems.

* **Representational State Transfer** : means that the resource i.e. image or feild in the database, state will remain constant, but it changes when the client requires it(in any format he wants: application/json, application/xml, html, image,...etc)

* **Hypermedia vs Hypertext**: **hypertext** is the way of making text interactive by transfering to another text, in another meaning the hypertext is the text that contains another texts via `Hyperlinks`, **hypermedia** is an extension of the hypertext by adding `Media` (videos, images, text,...etc) instead of depending on single text.

* **HATEOAS**: means the interaction of a client with a `REST application` must be driven by `hypermedia`, or to put it simply, the client should obtain all `URIs` for `every resource` it needs by following links in the representation of resources themselves, not by relying on out-of-band information, like URI patterns given in documentation, as many APIs do
