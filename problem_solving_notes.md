# Removing Stars From a String

*Best Practicies and issues for latest solution*
- Use of Stack: Your current solution uses a stack, which is a reasonable approach but can be simplified.

- Reversing and Iteration: You are iterating from the end of the string and reversing it, which can make the logic a bit more complex and harder to follow.

- Memory Usage: The use of a stack increases memory usage. You can reduce the space complexity to O(1) by using a string directly.

* Improved Solution: Instead of using a stack, you can use a single string as a result builder. This approach is easier to understand and avoids unnecessary space usage.
